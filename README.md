# ðŸ“° Fake vs. Real News Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **NLP-based feature engineering** combined with **machine learning classification** can effectively detect fake vs. real news.  

We extract and leverage three key categories of signals:  

- ðŸ”¹ **Semantic signals** â†’ sentiment & emotion analysis  
- ðŸ”¹ **Lexical signals** â†’ keyword distributions & usage patterns  
- ðŸ”¹ **Structural signals** â†’ text length & formatting cues  

By combining these features, we build **interpretable ML models** that can distinguish real news from fake news with **competitive accuracy**.
